# Transfusion Management App

## Description

This mobile application was developed using the Ionic framework for the Human-Computer Interaction course. The app has been tested using a mobile emulator. I collaborated on this app with my colleague [Karlo Ivic](https://github.com/AmigosLP).


The application is designed for the transfusion department. Patients can use this app to reserve a blood analysis appointment and voluntary blood donation. They can also access their blood analysis results and have a digital blood donor card through the app. Medical staff also use the app to approve or reject patient requests for blood analysis. Medical personnel can use the app to deliver blood analysis results to patients.

After successfully logging into the app, patients have the option to schedule a new blood draw appointment, view previous appointments, and access their blood donor card. If a patient selects a time slot that is already occupied, they will need to choose a different time.

Regarding medical staff, after logging in, they can review today's patients and check requests from new patients for appointments. When viewing patient requests, they have access to a list of patients who need blood draws.

### Blood Draw Scheduling

Patients choose a date and time for their appointment. If they select January 20, 2023, at 14:30, they will receive a message indicating that the time slot is already filled, and they should choose another.
